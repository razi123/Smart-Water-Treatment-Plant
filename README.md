# Smart_Water_Treatment_Plant

The World Health Organization reports that for the first time ever, the majority of the world's population lives in a city, and this proportion continues to grow with projections of 70 percent by 2050.

One of a city's most important pieces of critical infrastructure is its water system. With populations in cities growing, it is inevitable that water consumption will grow as well.


# Objective of the project: 
Even today most of the water treatment process is carried manually which may not be feasible in the years to come. Since Automation is a key to water treatment plant, till date Conventional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have been used.

1. Produce water that is safe for human consumption
2. Produce water that is appealing to the people's health. 
3. Produce water - using facilities which can be constructed and operated at a reasonable cost


# Tasks

1. Focus on an innovative and intelligent control and monitoring system for Water Treatment Plant.
2. Automating all treatment stages (aeration, coagulation, flocculation and filtration).
3. Avoid human intervention and replacing PLC system with portable, compact and powerfull raspberry Pi
4. Monitor live plant status(sensors, actuators)  

# Operating system and software 
  Software: 
  
    1. ARM mbed platform: This platform has an mbed Library, which provides an API-driven approach to read data from sensors 
       using API’s.
    2. Compiler is entirely web-based and run online, hence no software to download or install.
    
  Operating system:
  
    1. RASPBIAN: A free operating system based on Debian, optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. 
  
  Hardware:
  
    1. Raspberry Pi 3: The Raspberry Pi is a low cost computer, find more info @ https://www.raspberrypi.org/ 
    2. NXP LPC11u24: mbed microcontroller's packaged as a small 40-pin DIP, 0.1-inch pitch form-factor making it convenient for
       prototyping, find more info @ https://www.mbed.com/en/
